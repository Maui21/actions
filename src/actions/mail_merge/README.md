# Mail Merge

This is WIP but could be handy.

Right now it just generates an html file on disk as proof-of-concept. Instead it needs to actually send out emails.

It's also been hard-coded to care about certain fields, since the customer demo had a narrow use case. It could be made more general so long as there is a minimum set of fields including email address, name etc. Tags & required fields should be used for this instead.
